# README #

FramePress is a custom, lightweight WordPress framework designed to quickly build a WordPress theme without having to worry about adding often used features (breadcrumbs, custom posts etc.) to work every single time. Install this frame as a parent theme, and customize the child theme using Bootstrap. 

Quick and easy.

### How to use ###

- Upload to theme directory
- Activate in the backend
- Ready!

### Updates ###

FramePress updates all by itself when the updater plugin is installed. This should be installed together with the framework.

### Shortcodes ###

To use these just place the shortcode in the template on a place where you want it.

- Breadcrumbs: <?php framepress_breadcrumb(); ?>
- Navigation: <?php framepress_numeric_posts_nav(); ?>
